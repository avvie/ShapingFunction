# Shaping Function

My first attempt at reproducing a screenspace image effect I found on the internet.

Click Play in the editor to run in the sample scene. The shader is time dependent and unless Play is pressed
or the editor is forced to update transforms, time wont advance

Goal was to practice and understand shaders more
credits to 'Danilo Guanabara' for the idea
